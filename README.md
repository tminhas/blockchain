# Blockchain Project for Cyber-Physical Systems

This is an implementation of a blockchain using Python. 
It showcases the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, including proof of work, proof of stake, and cryptographic hashing using SHA-256.

## Features

- Proof of Work (PoW): Demonstrates how computational puzzles ensure the security and immutability of the blockchain by adding new blocks.
- Proof of Stake (PoS): Introduces an alternative consensus mechanism based on validators' economic stake, reducing energy consumption and promoting decentralization.
- SHA-256 Hashing: Utilizes the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function to generate secure and unique digital fingerprints (hashes) for each block.
- Flask Web Application: Includes a basic Flask web application to interact with the blockchain and demonstrate block mining and validation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask (for the web application)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

## Clients
The client scripts used in this project are for PLC communication using Python, for testing purposes there is a test client, which does not require a PLC connection.
